#### The Next Step In APIs

APIs are the highways of modern day internet architecture. It is what has enabled extremely useful services to proliferate and change the world for the better.

APIs are great, however, there is a fundamental limitation. They are fundamentally designed for machines.

It is clear that the world is headed in a direction where we want to able to talk to APIs the way we talk to humans - in plain, simple language.

Now, this does not remove the need for an interface. Visual interfaces in many cases are still a better UX experience than just chat.

A wide range of use cases can be boiled down to just interfacing with APIs better. And if humans were given the ability to directly interface with APIs without the need to go through clunky software and overly complicated interface, we could change the world.

To this end, we introduce a new paradigm -  Language Programming Interface.

#### Service providers should provide service. Language models should provide language. Let us provide the interface, the plumbing, the roads.

We want to be the language infrastructure company for you. We believe the companies that build the services should continue to build world class services. We believe, the service providers, such as Stripe or Twitter or Shopify or Instagram should focus on what they do best - building the services.
